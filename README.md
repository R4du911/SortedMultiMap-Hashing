# SortedMultiMap-Hashing

Implementation of basic functions of SortedMultiMap Collection using Hashing with open addressing - double hashing collision resolution

What I learnt from this project:
- Collections library
- how ADTs implemented using Hashing concept work
- when and why this type of ADT implementation should be used
- different types of hashing collision resolutions
